# Python Programming Assignments

This repository contains Python solutions for basic programming problems. The assignments focus on mathematical computations, loops, and pattern printing. Below are the included tasks:

### 1. Calculate Simple and Compound Interest
A program to compute Simple Interest (SI) and Compound Interest (CI) using user-provided inputs for principal amount, rate of interest, and time.

---

### 2. Fibonacci Series
A program to generate the Fibonacci series up to a specified number of terms. Each term in the series is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

---

### 3. Number Pattern Pyramid
A program to print a pyramid pattern of numbers where each row contains an increasing sequence:
```
1  
1 2  
1 2 3  
1 2 3 4  
1 2 3 4 5  
1 2 3 4 5 6  
1 2 3 4 5 6 7  
```

### 4. Repeating Number Triangle
A program to print a pattern of repeated numbers in descending rows:
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1  
2 2 2 2 2 2  
3 3 3 3 3  
4 4 4 4  
5 5 5  
6 6
